## Hi there 👋 (WIP)


###  I'm Babajide Martins Adebiyi (Jide Martins)!

I'm a passionate technologist focused on building secure, scalable, and efficient systems. My work lives at the intersection of **Development** and **Security**, driving robust solutions from the ground up.

## ✨ Core Focus Areas

* 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & App Security:** Dedicated to finding and fixing vulnerabilities, especially in web and mobile applications (e.g., strong knowledge of OWASP Top 10).
* 🚀 **DevOps / DevSecOps:** Automating everything from code deployment to security checks using CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
* 🐍 **Python Development:** Focused on scripting, automation, building robust APIs (with frameworks like Flask/Django), and developing custom security utilities.
* ☁️ **Cloud & Infrastructure:** Experience with major cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for high-availability systems.
* 💡 **IT Infrastructure:** Strong foundational knowledge of networking protocols, operating systems, and system administration principles.
